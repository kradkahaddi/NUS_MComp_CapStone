# Word Lists

## 4 Stages of Collection

1. Manual scraping from merriam webster
2. Using regex to remove all the words in paranthesis
3. manually removing some prepositions and other words
4. checking the intersection of both lists and removing common words.

The order is raw->proc->cleaned->final
